                    <p>
                        My first Discord bot, written in an older version of Discord.py
                        <br/>This bot was designed to allow me to test different things, and learn
                        to create my own bot, with experience.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This bot is deprecated, and offline.
                    </p>

                    <h1>CensorShip</h1>
                    <p>Another one of my bots, this was one of my first bots created openly to solve an issue
                        for the public. When this bot was created, all of my servers had a strict zero-tolerance
                        policy for racism, homophobia, and hate speech in general. 

                        <br/><br/>A lot of servers would punish this behavior by banning the user, however most of the 
                        well-known bots didn't have the option to instantly ban a user.

                    <p>
                        A Discord server designed as my "central hub" for all of my Discord bots.
                        <br/>This was bot support, my YouTube channel hangout, and my friends hangout, all in one server.

                        <br/><br/>As my bot development died off, so has this server.

                        <br/><br/>This server no longer exists. It has been replaced by <a href="#dogknifedev">DogKnife Development</a>
