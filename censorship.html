                    <h1>CensorShip Explanation</h1>
                    <p>Another one of my bots, this was one of my first bots created openly to solve an issue
                        for the public. When this bot was created, all of my servers had a strict zero-tolerance
                        policy for racism, homophobia, and hate speech in general.

                        <br/>A lot of servers would punish this behavior by banning the user, however most of the 
                        well-known bots didn't have the option to instantly ban a user.

                        This bot would change that issue, but the list was hardcoded, meaning was set by myself, and
                        could not be customized from server to server.

                        <br/>Because of this reason, it was very hard to find people that would want to use the bot
                        for its moderation purposes.

                        <br/><br/>This bot is written on an older version of Discord.py, and is deprectated.
